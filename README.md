# Setup:

1. Make sure to have node installed.
    Check by running in terminal:
    `node -v`
    If a version number is not displayed, consult the internet to install node or contact Hayes Capers.

2. Install npm packages.
    While in the project root folder run `npm install` in the terminal

# Usage:

1. Write code for each algorithm directly into the function in each algorithm file (the file without .solution or .test).

2. In the terminal run `npm test <filename>` to test your answer.
    - Ex. `npm test removeDuplicates` will run the test suite for the removeDuplicates algorithm.
    - **Note:** the .js file extension is not required.
